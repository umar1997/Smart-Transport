1. Weighted TSP based on the number of passengers in the bus/shuffle
Find all the routes for all the people on the bus and the roads which 
are most used to acheive the destination for most people will have less people.

2. Through the models defined in the paper we are trying to acheive a temporal optimization technique
where we are using a choice function, cost matrix and cost function even to let go of some passengers, 
but the only spatial optimization we are trying to do is differentiate high demand corridors from low demand.
Here we can use the central system model

If we are actually trying to solve the real problem then we need a survey to see when would a passenger 
actually prefer a bus over a car. Simply saying that if we have an on demand system it would increase the passengers willing to come
then we are not looking at the need of the target audience properly. What price range is suitable for travelling from A to B (Specific/Known places)
and how many stops later should he reach his destination (Meaning how far is he willing to detour from the optimal route before he thinks this is a waste of time)


Problem with Shared Taxis are No congestion and high prices and one person drop in A and other in B and third in C. Further more 
The buses or vehicles arent going around empty looking for clients (Saving time and cost)

ML Work that can be done for one is based on how long the perosn has to wait and many detours he has to take we can see the percentage
of acceptability of the person willing to ride that public on demand transport.

What if for the customer that is dropped or will cost us more to reroute and add him to the bus route in that case
we send a car and then the passenger has the choice of whether he wants to opt for the expensive ride or not 


Dictionary:

Alight/Boarding = Getting on or off a vehicle
rationalization = 
Demand Responsive Transit = Dial a Ride System (Door to Door) - Isnt a proper replacement for the Traditional Bus Service
				Traditional Bus Service are meant to not reduce congestion and be relatively cheaper
Shared Taxis = The term above may come close to the idea of shared taxis which also work on specific demands but do 
			not cater many people at a time	(No congestion and high prices)
			And one person drop in A and other in B and third in C. (Reason to adopt spatial optimia=zation)
FMOD (Flexible Mobility On Demand) = PRovides different levels of services to each person (Taxi, Shared Taxi, MiniBus)
